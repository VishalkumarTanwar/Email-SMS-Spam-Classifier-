# Email-SMS-Spam-Classifier-
This project is a Machine Learning–based Email/SMS Spam Classifier that identifies whether a message is Spam or Not Spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is trained on text data using TF-IDF vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier, and the application is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
