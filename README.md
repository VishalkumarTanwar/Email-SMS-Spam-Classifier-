# Email-SMS-Spam-Classifier-
This project is a Machine Learning–based Email/SMS Spam Classifier that identifies whether a message is Spam or Not Spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is trained on text data using TF-IDF vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier, and the application is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user interface.

Key Features:

Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, stemming)

TF-IDF based feature extraction

Naive Bayes classification

Real-time prediction through Streamlit UI

Simple and user-friendly interface

Tech Stack:

Python

Scikit-learn

NLTK

Streamlit

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment .
